# if this is not desired use {variable!u} instead ("u" is for "unsafe")
#
# if you want to use date-like fields (as `document.date` for example) with a date-specific formatting
# (e.g `{document.date:%Y%m%d}`) there are some times when the date field is not available from the backend,
# and instead would be a `NotLoaded` or `NotAvailable` value. As this is not a proper date, the formatter
# will not been able to format it, and will throw an exception.
# To prevent this, you can use the `!d` conversion, which will replace `NotLoaded` or `NotAvailable` with
# `datetime.datetime.min` (in general: 01/01/0001) which will prevent the exception.
# You will have to write your template like this: `{document.date!d:%Y%m%d}`
